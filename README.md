Project 3: Arcade Game 16-09-2015
===============================
This project is part of the Front-end developer nanodegree at Udacity.
I was provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools I add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.
